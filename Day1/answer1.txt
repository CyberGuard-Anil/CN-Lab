Lab 1: Week-1: Networking Tools


1. What is Networking and its significance in computer networks?

=  Networking is the process of connecting two or more computers/devices together so they can share data, resources, and services. These connections can be wired or wireless and are used in homes, offices, and over the internet.

 Significance of Networking:

1. Resource Sharing: Users can share printers, files, internet connections, etc.
2. Communication: Allows people to communicate via emails, VoIP, video calls.
3. Centralized Data Management: Data can be stored and managed from a central server.
4. Scalability: Easy to add new devices without major changes.
5. Internet Access: Enables computers to connect to the global internet.
6. Components required for Data Communication in a Computer Network:
7. Networking involves both hardware and software components.

Hardware Components:

1. Network Interface Card (NIC)
= It is a physical device installed in computers to connect them to a network.
2. Network Cable
= These are physical cables (like Ethernet cables) used to connect network devices.
3. RJ-45 Connector
= It is a standard connector used for Ethernet networking.
4. Hub
= A basic device that connects multiple devices in a LAN. It sends data to all connected devices.
5. Switch
= More advanced than a hub. It sends data only to the intended device, improving efficiency
6. Router
= Connects different networks together, like a home LAN to the internet. It routes traffic based on IP addresses.

Software Components:

1. Protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP)
= Set of rules that define how data is transmitted over the network.
2. Operating System Network Stack
= Manages network connections and handles data transmission.
3.   Firewall & Security Software
= Monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.
