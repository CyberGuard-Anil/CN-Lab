2. Discuss different network diagnostic tools
= Network diagnostic tools are used to test, monitor, and troubleshoot network-related problems. These tools help in identifying connectivity issues, analyzing paths, checking IP addresses, and verifying DNS responses.

a) ping
1. ping command is used to check whether a host (remote system) is reachable or not.
2. It sends ICMP Echo Request packets and waits for Echo Reply.
3. Useful to check basic network connectivity.
Example:
ping www.google.com

b) traceroute / tracert

1. traceroute (Linux) or tracert (Windows) shows the path that packets take from your computer to a destination host.
2. It displays all the routers/hops the packet passes through.
Example:
traceroute www.google.com    # Linux  
tracert www.google.com       # Windows

c) netstat

1. netstat shows active network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.
2. Helps in checking open ports and connections.
Example:
netstat -a

d) nslookup

1. nslookup is used to query DNS and get IP addresses associated with domain names.
2. It can also perform reverse lookups.
Example:
nslookup www.facebook.com

e) ipconfig / ifconfig

1. ipconfig (Windows) and ifconfig (Linux) show network interface configuration details.
2. Displays IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, etc.
Examples:
ipconfig           # Windows  
ifconfig           # Linux

f) iptables

1. iptables is a command-line firewall tool in Linux used to define rules for traffic filtering.
2. Can be used to allow/block specific ports or IPs.
Examples:
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT   # Allow HTTP  
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.100 -j DROP      # Block IP
